# Bookbot

This is my first guided project for [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend) backend bootcamp course.

## Download instructions

To download and use Bookbot, move to the directory you want it in and run:

`git clone https://github.com/030820acc/bookbot.git`

This will install the main program and the example_books directory so you can use it immediately.

## Examples

After downloading move into the Bookbot directory and run:

`python ./main.py`

It will prompt you to type a book file path. Type `example_books/frankenstein.txt` or `example_books/mobydick.txt' to see the data about them or add your own.
